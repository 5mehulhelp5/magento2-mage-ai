# Magento 2 MageAI Extension
This Magento 2 extension uses OpenAI‚Äôs GPT models (ChatGPT) to automatically generate high-quality short and long product descriptions based on product attributes like name, features, material, etc. It‚Äôs a powerful tool to save time and improve the content quality across your catalog.

‚ù§Ô∏è The goal of this extension is to remain fully open-source and continuously expand by integrating every possible way to use AI with Magento 2. From writing content to helping customers, improving SEO, or automating tasks ‚Äî the idea is to make Magento and AI work great together. I‚Äôm building it to be flexible and helpful for everyone, and I‚Äôd love for others to join in. If you‚Äôre into Magento or AI, your ideas and contributions are always welcome. Let‚Äôs create something awesome together!

## Features
- Generate product descriptions using your own custom prompt for full control and flexibility.
- Customize prompt templates using %s (attribute) and %d (word count)
- Choose OpenAI model (gpt-4, gpt-3.5-turbo, text-davinci-003, etc.)
- Set target word count for short and full descriptions
- Supports both:
    - text-davinci-003 (completion endpoint)
    - gpt-3.5-turbo, gpt-4, gpt-4o, etc. (chat endpoint)
- Clean, valid HTML output ready to use in WYSIWYG editor
- Compatible with Page Builder
